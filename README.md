  <h1>There's backstage, and then there's <i>backstage</i> backstage.</h1>
  Are you lost? I think, perhaps, you may be lost. Listen, I completely 
  understand: backstage can be cool. You almost feel like a VIP when you're 
  wandering around backstage. You get to see all the bustle and the excitement 
  of what goes on behind the curtains as performers prepare their magic with 
  which to dazzle you. Are you interested in <i>that</i> kind of backstage? If 
  so, here's a free ticket to <i>that</i> kind of backstage:

      alt="a ticket to an amusement bearing the words 'Mad Alex presents the 
        Carnival of Calamity Backstage' with the 'Pass' stamped on it and made 
        to appear like blood. On the right, in sideways script, are printed 
        'The Groundskeeper' beside 'Admit One' and a QR code. The QR code goes 
        nowhere"

  I think you will find <i>that</i> kind of backstage far more entertaining. 
  This here that you're looking at? This is the <i>backstage</i> backstage. 
  This is the office backstage. This is where projects and kanban boards and 
  sticky notes make their home. Where words like "agile" and "scrum" are 
  thrown around unironically and immediately thrown in the trash overflowing 
  with crumpled up paper and used up ball point pens. This is where the break 
  room is lined with linoleum, glaring flourescents, weak coffee, and day-old 
  doughnuts. This is where backroom deals are struck with performers made to 
  appear glamorous by Hollywood but really are nothing more than two or three 
  disgruntled managers and hopefuls trying desperately to negotiate a contract 
  neither of them will hate.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other words, this is where you don't wanna be unless you work here.

  Now, perhaps I can interest you in one of our many shows? We currently have 
  a number of them by which you may find yourself greatly entertained! Please, 
  select from any of them. Tickets are not expensive, I assure you, and I 
  daresay you may find the entertainment exceeds the price!
